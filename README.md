# xxDevPlus

this is intended: 

xxDevPlus should become a collection of smart tools and base classes for most any java App and/or csharp App 
- in other words: it schould become a smart and reliable developer's kernel addressing most common developers' tasks.

status:

- because of yearlong illnesses are the csharp Classes way behind the java Classes - by far outdated in terms of functionality and in   terms of class names - not even the class names have been updated so far. it will take me years to make the csharp classes valid.

- Many classes are really well tested and really smart "beasts od burdons" like Chain, Pile, KeyPile, ctx

- Many other classes are to be ignored because only there f√ºr evaluation of future aproaches

I intend to provide samples and use cases for selected classes and methods it time and healty allows.
