# xxDevPlus

license: dual - free for non commercial use.

this is intended: 

xxDevPlus should become a collection of smart tools and base classes for most any java App and/or csharp App 
- in other words: it schould become a smart and reliable developers' kernel addressing most common developers' tasks.

status:

- because of yearlong illnesses are the csharp Classes way behind the java Classes - by far outdated in terms of functionality and in   terms of class names and method signatures - not even the class names have been updated so far. 
It will take me years to make the csharp classes valid.

- Many classes are really well tested and are really smart and fast and reliable "beasts od burdons" like Chain, Pile, KeyPile, ctx

- Many other classes are to be ignored because only there f√ºr evaluation of future aproaches

- I suggest that you USE it by calling the methods rather then DEVELOP it into newer versions. This is because the internals are really really complex to implement and to understand - think of it as something like a vm or a library who's internals you would not want to see or even touch.

I intend to provide samples and use cases for selected classes and methods if time and health allow.
